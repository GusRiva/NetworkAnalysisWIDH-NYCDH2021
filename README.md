### Introduction

The world is full of networks and different topics of study in the humanities can make up networks: people, texts, ideas, etc. This workshop will introduce the basics of network analysis for the humanist. We will learn how to design a network in order to answer research questions in the humanities, how to create and visualize networks with open software and how to interpret some of their most important features and metrics. Participants will practice the skills acquired on a corpus of networks of characters in movies and theater plays.
